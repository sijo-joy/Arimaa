# Arimaa
Arimaa is a game that is played on an 8x8 chess-like board. There are two players (gold and silver) that have 6 different animal types: one elephant, one camel, two horses, two dogs, two cats, and eight rabbits. The objective of the game is to get one of your rabbits completely over to the other side of the board or to completely eliminate your opponents rabbits. It is possible to capture and remove opponent pieces from the board using the four designated trap squares on the board. However for this to work a larger piece must push a smaller piece into one of the trap squares to eliminate it. Should a smaller piece be adjacent to an opponents larger piece it is rendered immobile until the larger piece is no longer adjacent.
